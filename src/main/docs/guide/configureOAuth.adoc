To get Facebook OAuth2 up and running on your application will take a bit of work and configuration on
https://developers.facebook.com[Facebook's Developer Platform]. Go ahead and sign in (if you haven't signed up yet, signup).

Select `Create App` and five your Facebook project a name. In this case we name it `OAuth-Test`

Wait a moment while Facebook creates your new project, once it is done it will redirect you to your apps dashboard.

We want to login using Facebook so click `Set Up` on the Facebook Login option. This will bring us to the `Quickstart` page,
select `Other`

Why did we choose other and not web? Web is specifically for javascript applications such as Facebook's native React or
Google's Angular. Other is geared toward OAuth2 authentication taking place server-side, like in our case how we are
performing OAuth2 authentication using a plugin in Grails. To read more about it follow the link provided by Facebook
under "Manually Build a Login Flow".

At this point we need to take a look at our `Facebook Login -> Settings`

In order for our app to be able to talk back to Facebook we need to authorize it under `ValidOAuth redirect URIs`. Go
ahead and enter `http://localhost:8080/oauth/authenticate/facebook` so that Facebook knows its ok to talk to our plugin.

Now we need to find our app credentials. On the left under `Dashboard` click `Settings -> Basic` to view your `App ID`
and `App Secret`.

This is all the setup that needs to be done in Facebook. Write down your `App ID` and `App Secret` we will need it when
 configuring the application. Now we will move on to setting up our app.
