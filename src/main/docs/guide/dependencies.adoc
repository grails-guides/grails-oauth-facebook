First thing we need to do is add the `spring-security-core` and `spring-security-rest` plugins to our `build.gradle` file.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle

include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0, tag=secDependency]

<1> We need to exclude `spring-security-core` from `spring-security-rest` as it is bringing in an older version of core
and we need to ensure we are using the most up to date version.
