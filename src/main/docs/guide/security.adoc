Second, we need to go ahead and generate our basic spring security constructs by executing the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ grails s2-quickstart demo User Role
----

After the above command has been executed you should now have a `Role`, `User`, and `UserRole` domain object located in
your `grails-app/domain/demo` folder. In addition in our `grails-app/conf` we now also have an `application.groovy` that
contains our security configuration.
