Next we need to create our services to return all our books and our favourite ones. First we leverage data services
for our basic functionality.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookDataService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/BookDataService.groovy[]
----

Now we will code a more advanced version of a data service where we maintain the data service `save` in the interface and
implement a custom `findBookFavouriteBookId` finder in an abstract implementation of our interface.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookFavouriteDataService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/BookFavouriteDataService.groovy[]
----

Finally we will write up two custom `findAlls` by leveraging Gorm where queries.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookGormService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/BookGormService.groovy[]
